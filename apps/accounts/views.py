"""The sign-in page, and signing out.

One page offering two doors, in the order they should be used: **Synology SSO**
as the button, the local password behind a disclosure below it. That ordering
is the whole design — the fallback has to be present, because an OIDC-only app
is unreachable exactly when SSO is broken, and it has to be visibly secondary,
because an organisation that gets into the habit of using it is an organisation with
passwords in two places.

With ``OIDC_ENABLED`` off (a fresh checkout, a development machine) the local
form is simply the only thing on the page, opened.
