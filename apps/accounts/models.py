"""The Synology SSO connection, and the identities that arrive over it.

Two models. ``SSOConfiguration`` is the connection — one row, edited from a
page, and everything below the first heading is about it. ``SSOIdentity`` is one
DSM account attached to one local account, and it is what lets a person have
both ways in.

---- the connection ----

This is a **reversal of an earlier decision**, taken deliberately and with its
cost understood. The client secret used to live only in the environment, which
is where secrets belong: a value in `.env` is not in the database, not in a
`dumpdata`, and not in whatever copies the database. Moving it here puts it in
all three — most concretely in Hyper Backup, which copies `/data` nightly to
wherever that share is backed up to.

What made it worth doing anyway is that the *other* half of the OIDC setup is a
web page whatever we do: Synology's SSO Server has no supported way to create an
OIDC application except its own GUI. So the choice was never "config files or a
web UI", it was "one web UI plus an SSH session and a container restart", or one
web UI. The second is what somebody standing in front of a broken login at nine
in the evening can actually use.

Three things reduce the damage rather than pretend it away:

* **The secret is encrypted at rest** with a key derived from
  ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`` — which is still only in the environment. A stolen
  `db.sqlite3` on its own does not yield the secret. Someone with both the file
  and the environment has everything either way, so this buys exactly one
  thing: the backup copy is not enough.
* **It is never sent back to the browser.** The form takes a new value or leaves
  the stored one alone; there is no request that returns it.
* **Only a superuser may see the page**, which is a narrower door than the
  People page (staff), because this one decides how everybody authenticates.

The environment still works. Nothing here is required, and with no row in this
table the app reads exactly the settings it always did — which is what keeps a
fresh checkout, and the container's first boot, working with no database at all.

    An SSO account used to be a row whose ``username`` *was* the provider's
    ``sub``, which is a fine way to store an identity right up to the moment one
    person has both ways in. A local account has a username somebody chose; the
    ``sub`` has to live somewhere else for the two to be the same row. Here.

    Rows created before this model still work: apps/accounts/oidc.py looks the
    ``sub`` up here first and falls back to ``username``, and mints the missing
    row at the next sign-in.

    ---- what the two constraints are for ----

    ``subject`` is **unique**, so one DSM identity cannot be attached to two
    local accounts — two rows to sign in as, with no way to say which one a
    token means. And it is a **OneToOne** on the account, so one local account
    cannot collect several DSM identities: the organisation has one provider, and
    an account with two subs is a question ("which one is this?") that nothing
    would answer.

    Both matter more than they look, because linking is *automatic* by e-mail
    (see ``SynologyOIDCBackend._account_to_link``) and these are the two shapes
    a shared address could otherwise produce.
