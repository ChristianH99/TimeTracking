"""The URLs that do not need a session — and nothing else does.

This app's rule is the strict one: a login is required *everywhere*, and the
exceptions are enumerated here rather than opted into per view. The two shapes
give different failure modes and only one of them is safe. A decorator you have
to remember is a decorator somebody will forget, and the page they forget it on
looks completely normal — it just answers to anybody. A list, by contrast,
fails towards refusal: forget to add a URL here and the page asks for a login,
which is noticed in about four seconds.

Each entry is the ``(app_name, url_name)`` pair Django resolves, so a route
renamed without updating this file fails ``config/tests.py`` rather than
silently becoming reachable.
