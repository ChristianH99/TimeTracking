"""Where ``mozilla_django_oidc`` gets its settings from.

The library reads its configuration with ``import_from_settings``, which is
``getattr(settings, ...)`` — static for the life of the process. To let the
configuration live in the database instead, every class that reads it overrides
one hook:

    @staticmethod
    def get_settings(attr, *args):
        return sso.get_setting(attr, *args)

That hook is ``get_setting`` below, and it is deliberately narrow: it answers
for the handful of ``OIDC_*`` names this app actually lets somebody edit, and
hands everything else straight to Django's settings. A shim that tried to answer
for *every* setting would be a second settings system, and the first thing to
go wrong would be a typo silently resolving to ``None``.

The four classes that had to be subclassed are the backend, the two
authentication views (wired in through ``OIDC_AUTHENTICATE_CLASS`` and
``OIDC_CALLBACK_CLASS``, so the URL names stay exactly what the SSO server has
registered) and the session-refresh middleware. ``OIDCLogoutView`` was left
alone: it reads only ``LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL``, which nobody configures here.

**Caching.** This is consulted on every request that carries an OIDC session, so
it is cached — but only for a few seconds. The app runs two gunicorn workers and
each has its own local-memory cache, so a save in one worker cannot invalidate
the other; a short time-to-live is what makes them converge. Thirty seconds is
the deal: a change is live within half a minute everywhere, and nobody is
waiting on a spinner in the meantime.
