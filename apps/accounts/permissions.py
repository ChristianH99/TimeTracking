"""Who may reach the administration pages in this app.

Two levels, and the difference is deliberate rather than decorative:

* ``staff_required`` — the People page and the working time rules. Managing
  who may sign in, and what the app computes with.
* ``superuser_required`` — the SSO page. Deciding *how everybody
  authenticates*, and holding the client secret. A narrower door, because
  "may add an account" and "may repoint the whole app at a different identity
  provider" are not the same right, and the second one can be used to take the
  first.

Both answer **404, not 403**, the same choice the timesheet views make: a bare
403 is a dead end with no way back into the app, while a 404 renders the app's
own not-found page — and there is nothing to conceal either way, since the links
are only in the sidebar for the people who may follow them.

This is per-view authorisation, which is the opposite of the rule in
apps/accounts/pages.py — and the two are answering different questions. Whether
a page needs a *session* is a property of the whole app, so it is enumerated
centrally and fails towards refusal. Whether a signed-in member of the organisation
may see *these* pages is a property of the pages. The exposure a forgotten
decorator would create is covered from the other side, by tests that walk the
URLconf and refuse to let any of these routes answer an account without the
right.
