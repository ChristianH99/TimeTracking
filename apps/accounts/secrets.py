"""Encrypting the one secret this app stores.

The OIDC client secret lives in the database so it can be edited from a page
(apps/accounts/models.py says why that trade was made). Encrypting it at rest
buys exactly one thing, and it is worth being precise about which:

**A copy of the database is not enough.** `/data` is backed up nightly by Hyper
Backup to wherever that share goes, and a `db.sqlite3` sitting in a backup — or
handed to somebody to look at a bug — would otherwise carry a credential that
lets its holder impersonate this app to the SSO server. With this, opening it
also needs ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY``, which is only ever in the environment.

**It is not protection from someone who has the running system.** They have the
environment, so they have the key. Anyone who can read `/proc` or run
`docker exec` can read the secret, and no amount of key derivation changes that.
Encryption at rest is about the copies, not about the original.

The key is *derived* from ``DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`` rather than being a second thing
to configure, because a second secret is a second thing to lose — and losing it
would mean an SSO login that fails with no way to fix it except re-typing the
secret, which is exactly what happens here anyway when the key changes. That
failure is handled rather than hidden: ``decrypt`` returns "" and the settings
page says the stored secret can no longer be read and asks for it again.
