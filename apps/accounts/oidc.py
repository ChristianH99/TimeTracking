"""Signing in against the Synology SSO Server.

``mozilla_django_oidc`` does the protocol. This subclass does the three things
that are *this* deployment's business: deciding who a token describes, deciding
whether that person may come in, and keeping the local user row in step with
what DSM says today.

A note on the claims, because it is the part most likely to surprise you.
Synology's SSO Server has shipped different claim sets across DSM versions —
some builds return ``preferred_username``, some only ``sub`` and ``email``, and
the group claim has been absent entirely. So nothing here *requires* a claim
beyond ``sub``: the username falls back through three candidates, the display
name is optional, and the group check is opt-in (``OIDC_ALLOWED_GROUPS`` empty
means "anyone the SSO server authenticates", which is the right default for a
organisation and the wrong one the moment that server also serves guests).

``sub`` is the identity, not the username. A DSM account renamed from ``chris``
to ``christian`` keeps its ``sub``, and matching on the name instead would hand
that person a brand-new, empty account. The ``sub`` lives in an
``SSOIdentity`` row, and the human-readable name in
``first_name``/``last_name`` where it can change freely.

An account this app created for a token is *also* called by its ``sub``, which
reads oddly in the Django admin and is what every such row looked like before
those identity rows existed — ``filter_users_by_claims`` still answers to it, so
nothing created by an earlier version needs migrating. What it cannot do any
more is carry the identity on its own: a person who signs in **both ways** has a
username they chose, so the ``sub`` has to be somewhere that is not the username
column.

That is the other thing this file now does: a token whose e-mail address matches
exactly one local account is attached to it rather than given an account of its
own, and both ways in keep working. ``_account_to_link`` is where the hedges
are, and there are four of them, because an e-mail address is the tempting key
and the wrong one — this is the app's one deliberate exception to that, not a
change of mind about it.

        **This is the one place in the app that treats an e-mail address as
        something like an identity, and it is deliberately hedged about.** The
        objection is real and has not gone away: DSM lets two accounts share an
        address, an address can be reassigned to somebody else entirely, and an
        address is a claim the provider asserts rather than something this app
        can check. Matching on it carelessly means signing somebody in as
        somebody else, which is why questions 1 and 2 above are asked first and
        why this one is asked *only* about an account that has never been
        linked to anything.

        What it buys is the thing it was asked for: one person, one account,
        both ways in. Somebody who has a local password from before SSO was set
        up, or who keeps one so that a broken provider is not a locked door,
        does not end up with two half-accounts, two timesheets and
        two names in the People list.

        Four things have to be true, and each one is a shape a shared address
        could otherwise produce:

        * **The token carries an address, and does not say it is unverified.**
          Only an explicit ``email_verified: false`` refuses — the claim is
          absent on DSM builds that send nothing but ``sub`` and ``email``, and
          requiring it would mean linking never happens on the very provider
          this was written for.
        * **Exactly one active account has it.** Two is the ambiguous case and
          the dangerous one, and there is no tie-break worth inventing: the
          login carries on and creates its own account, which is visible and
          undoable rather than silent and wrong.
        * **That account has a local password.** An account without one is
          another *provider* identity that happens to share an address — a
          second DSM account, not the same person — and attaching this token to
          it would be exactly the mix-up the objection above describes.
        * **It is not already linked.** One account, one identity. The second
          ``sub`` to arrive with a shared address gets an account of its own.

        Nothing about it is undone silently: the link is a row a staff user can
        see on the account page and remove there.
