"""Forms for the organisation's accounts page.

There are two kinds of account in this app and the difference is the whole
reason these forms exist rather than a link to the Django admin.

A **local** account was created here: it has a username somebody chose and a
password this app stores. A **Synology** account is the local end of an OIDC
identity — its ``username`` is the provider's ``sub`` (a stable opaque string,
never an e-mail: apps/accounts/oidc.py says why), its display name and e-mail
are re-applied from the token on every sign-in, and it has no usable password
by construction.

``has_usable_password()`` is what tells them apart, and it is not a heuristic:
``SynologyOIDCBackend.create_user`` calls ``set_unusable_password()`` precisely
so that a DSM-managed account can never also be reachable through the local
form. So the rule is exact in the direction that matters — an account with no
usable password must not be offered a password field, because giving it one
would open the second door SSO exists to close.

What follows from that is what these forms refuse: a Synology account's
username, name and e-mail are DSM's to change, and anything typed here would be
overwritten at the next login while looking as though it had been saved.
