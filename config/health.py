"""``/healthz`` — the one ungated URL in the app.

Two decisions are worth stating, because both look like omissions:

**It says almost nothing.** One word, or a 503. It is unauthenticated, so
anything richer — a version, a user count, whether SSO is reachable — would be
organisation state handed to whoever asks. A check does not need it.

**It runs one query.** A process that is listening while its database has gone
is exactly the failure a health check exists to catch, and a view that returns
"ok" without touching the database cannot see it. One ``SELECT 1`` is the
cheapest thing that can.

The container's HEALTHCHECK and any uptime probe point here over plain HTTP on
127.0.0.1, which is also why nothing in settings.py redirects it to HTTPS.
