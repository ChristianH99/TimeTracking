    """Send /favicon.ico to the real icon under /static/.

    A browser asks for this on its own whenever a page does not name an icon,
    and it asks *per origin*, not per page — so with nothing here every visit
    logged `WARNING Not Found: /favicon.ico`, and the interesting warnings sat
    in among them. base.html names the icon now, which stops most of these
    being made at all; this catches the rest — a bookmark, a browser that
    ignores the tag, anything fetching the origin root.

    The URL is resolved *inside* the view rather than at import time. `STORAGES`
    uses WhiteNoise's manifest storage in every mode, so asking for a static URL
    raises until `collectstatic` has run — and doing that while the URLconf is
    being imported would make every management command fail on a fresh
    checkout, `collectstatic` itself included.

    Permanent, because it is: this is where the icon lives. Browsers cache it
    and stop asking.
