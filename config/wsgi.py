"""WSGI entry point — and the place a *server's* own startup rules live.

The ALLOWED_HOSTS check is here rather than in settings.py on purpose.
``collectstatic`` is a required release step and it runs with DEBUG off and no
hosts configured, quite legitimately; only something that is about to answer
requests needs the setting. Left empty, the process starts and then refuses
every request with DisallowedHost — which from a phone on the shop floor reads as
"the app is broken", with nothing in the container log saying otherwise.
