"""Django settings for the time tracking app.

The app runs in one container on a Synology NAS, behind that NAS's own reverse
proxy, and authenticates its users against the Synology SSO Server over OIDC.
Three consequences run through this file:

* **It never terminates TLS itself.** The proxy does, and talks plain HTTP to
  this process. So the HTTPS settings below are about *trusting the proxy's
  headers* rather than about redirecting — see the proxy block.
* **Everything it writes lives under DATA_DIR**, never beside the code, because
  the code is replaced wholesale by the next image and the database is every
  hour anybody has worked. A checkout keeps DATA_DIR at the repository root,
  which is what a developer expects; the container points it at a bind mount.
* **Secrets come from the environment.** ``.env.example`` documents every one of
  them; nothing here loads a .env file automatically.

# looking untidy: the redirect_uri this app sends to the SSO server is built
# from the request, so without these two settings it goes out as
# `http://zeit.haeusslerr.de/...`, which the SSO server rejects as an
# unregistered callback. The symptom is a login loop with no error message.
#
# Both require the proxy to actually set the headers. In DSM the rule needs
# custom headers `X-Forwarded-Proto: $scheme` and `Host: $host` — see
# DEPLOYMENT.md §2. Turn this off only if something else terminates TLS
# differently; on a direct connection a forwarded header is a client-supplied
