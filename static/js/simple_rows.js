/* Add and remove rows of a short formset, with a "+" and an "×".
 *
 * Used by four pages here: the break rules and the special-leave threshold
 * table (both are "a handful of like things, and the number of them is whatever
 * the agreement says"), the special leave granted to one employee, and the
 * stretches of work inside one day. None of them is a canvas and none has
 * geometry.
 *
 * ---- the formset trap ----
 *
 * A formset is an **index range**, not a list, and everything that can go wrong
 * here comes from forgetting it:
 *
 *   * adding means minting a row at the next free index — every `name` and `id`
 *     carrying that number — *and* bumping TOTAL_FORMS. Miss the last step and
 *     the row is simply not read on POST: the page looks right and the value
 *     vanishes on save.
 *   * removing an existing row means ticking its DELETE box and hiding it. It
 *     must never leave the DOM: a form missing from the POST is a hole in the
 *     range, and Django reads the absent fields against that form's own
 *     defaults, concludes it changed, and validates it. That is how a removed
 *     row comes back wearing "This field is required".
 *
 * A row that was never saved has no pk to delete, so clearing it and taking it
 * out of TOTAL_FORMS *is* safe — but only when it is the last one, or the
 * range gets a hole. Simpler to treat both the same way, which is what this
 * does.
 *
 * static/js/roster_plan.js does the same job for the week planner. It is not
 * shared because that one also has to move a card between columns and rewrite
 * its hidden date, and the shared version was mostly a parameter saying which
 * half to skip.
